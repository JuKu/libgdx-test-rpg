Final Boss Lair or even dungeon level music to create a creepy atmosphere. You may use this for any project that you like but, I will ask that you let me know that you are going to use it and I would love to see the finished project as well. I am open to the idea of rearranging it to fit your game just leave me an email and we will see what we can do! Cheers!!

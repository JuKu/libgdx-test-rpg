RPG music for a lost village or what not or a dreary graveyard level but, could be used for a lot more! You may use this for any project that you like but, I will ask that you let me know that you are going to use it and I would love to see the finished project as well. I am open to the idea of rearranging it to fit your game just leave me an email and we will see what we can do! Cheers!! (Music made to be loop-able)
